## Client Background

My client is Branchless Bank. They offer banking services in Texas to men and women of all ages. Their strength involves having a close relationship with each one of their customers, treating people like they themselves would like to be treated. Their weakness is that they do not currently have a suitable online banking app.

## Project Overview

This project is about bringing this bank into the 21st century and remaining competitive amongst other banks.

## Project Drivers

The end goal of this project is to streamline their customers banking needs in an efficient manner that is easily performed and helps save time.

## Target Audience

The target audience for this app will be both men and women aging from 30-50 years of age. If we can get the older generation comfortable with using this app then we are certain that we will be able to expedite the user experience for all ages as it is a safe assumption that the younger generations will utilize this platform.

## Competitor Analysis

Our competitors will be apps for all other major banks, such as Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and more. Their strength is that they already have a large customer base and their weakness is that they don't have as personal of a relationship with their users. What differentiates us from them is our close attention to detail and our simplified approach to design and development.

## Tone and Perception

We believe that our clients audience is currently impressed with Branchless Bank. It is our job to reinforce this belief with a strong app that will continue to build the relationship between Branchless Bank and their customers. We aim to take the process that their customers are already familiar/comfortable with and reinstate that in the digital/mobile realm.

## Targeted Message

The message that we are trying to convey is that it is safe to utilize digital services in 2016. Since Branchless Bank does not currently occupy an online mobile banking app it is paramount that we help them achieve this goal in a manner that is not abrasive, deterring or demanding.

## Project Specifics

We would like to include the Branchless Bank logo and other unique visuals/colors that their customers are already familiar with. This will help provide continuity in the users transition to mobile banking. We are not trying to reinvent the wheel.

## The Numbers

Our given budget for this project is $200,000. Our time line is 3 months.

## People Involved

Development/Design Team, Branchless Bank executives.
